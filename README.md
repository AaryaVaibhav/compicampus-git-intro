# Welcome to the CompiCampus Dive in to Git and Github 

Welcome to my CompiCampus "Dive in to Git and GitHub" Course!

I set up the class like this: First there will be a short input about Git and about the history of Git. Then you can take the written inputs and follow the exercises from the slide deck. In the form of an accompanied exercise.

Have fun discovering Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages! 

Cheers, Roman
