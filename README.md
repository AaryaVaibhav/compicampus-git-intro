# Welcome to the CompiCampus Dive in to Git and Github 

Welcome to my CompiCampus "Dive in to Git and GitHub" Course from 2019-03-25!

I set up the class like this: First there will be a short input about Git and about the history of Git. Then you can take the written inputs, learn the most important Git commands and follow the exercises for Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages from the slide deck. In the form of an accompanied exercise.

Have fun discovering Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages :smile:! 

Cheers, Roman 

And ask me, if any questions :-) :raised_hands:
